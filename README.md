## Java-Connect4 v.2
This Java Project is a connect 4 program with a javax.swing GUI and a minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning *and* a transposition table (HashMap).
This is the second version and has some large improvements over the first version. 

See https://github.com/JoshuaMcCorkell/Java-Connect4-v.1 for version 1 (or on second thoughts, don't!).
